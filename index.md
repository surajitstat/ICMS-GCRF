# Workshop Goals

This strategic workshop seeks to achieve two primary goals: (1) to provide a much-needed venue for interaction among both established and early career researchers from the Mathematical Sciences community to identify new global challenges arising in LMIC countries, propose novel mathematical and statistical solutions to these challenges, thereby  setting the foundation for establishing long-term and fruitful collaborative groups who will be able to compete for larger open GCRF call; (2) to provide a forum to develop  synergies among currently funded (2019/2020 start dates) EPSRC-GCFR grants focused on the disciplinary theme of  “Tackling global development challenges through mathematical sciences” or  “Building capacity to tackle global development challenges through mathematical sciences research.”
Building cross-connections throughout the workshop, through the exchange of statistical and mathematical ideas, techniques and tools previously limited in a single area-- the end-goal will be to consolidate these into a novel synthesis of methodologies leading to new breakthroughs in solving scientific problems from a multi-pronged and multi-disciplinary mathematical and statistical perspective. Along with the consolidation based on application areas, participants at the workshop will also explore possibilities of consolidation based on 

1.	Geographical focus (e.g. Africa, India, SE Asia)
2.	Mathematical and Statistical Methodology proposed to solve LMIC problems.
